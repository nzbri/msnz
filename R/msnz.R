# List the required explicit imports from this package below. Keep these to a
# minimum and instead use explicit package::function() syntax wherever possible
# to avoid importing libraries, to make dependencies clearer in the code. Note
# that the list of imports in the DESCRIPTION file is just information at the
# time of installation, to ensure that those packages are installed and hence
# can be called by this package.
#
# Roxygen will take the @import statements below and use them to populate the
# NAMESPACE file:

#' @importFrom magrittr %>%
#' @importFrom magrittr %<>%
NULL # needed just so that roxygen will process the statements above.
